  Project planning:
  
  Questions to ask yourself before writing any code:
  
  - What are the main containers of elements I need
    in this app?

    
      -heading
      -game status container (win/lose)
      -the languages container
      -the word container
      -keyboard
      -new game if game is over
  
   - What values will need to be saved in state vs.
    what values can be derived from the state?
 
     -saved in state
       correct word
       user input word
       guess count 

     -derived from state
       game status
       which languages are eleminated
       display blank
  
  - How will the user interact with the app? What
    events do I need to handle?
     
     -keyboard event
     -start new game
  
  
-saved guess letter lesson
 => simply get the letter that user click from keyboard(button)
 => Set onClick handler on key button and get clicked letter using event.target.innerText
      
      function handleKey(event){
        const letter = event.target.innerText;
        setGuessLetters(
          //Prevented duplicate letters in state
        prevLetter => prevLetter.includes(letter) ? prevLetter : [...prevLetter, letter])
      }

    Option (2)
    get clicked letter by passing letter to handlerKey function

    function handleKey(letter){
      setGuessLetters(
        //Prevented duplicate letters in state
      prevLetter => prevLetter.includes(letter) ? prevLetter : [...prevLetter, letter])
    }
