  Project planning:
  
  Questions to ask yourself before writing any code:
  
  - What are the main containers of elements I need
    in this app?

    
      -heading
      -game status container (win/lose)
      -the languages container
      -the word container
      -keyboard
      -new game if game is over
  
   - What values will need to be saved in state vs.
    what values can be derived from the state?
 
     -saved in state
       correct word
       user input word
       guess count 

     -derived from state
       game status
       which languages are eleminated
       display blank
  
  - How will the user interact with the app? What
    events do I need to handle?
     
     -keyboard event
     -start new game
  
  
-saved guess letter lesson
 => simply get the letter that user click from keyboard(button)
 => Set onClick handler on key button and get clicked letter using event.target.innerText
      
      function handleKey(event){
        const letter = event.target.innerText;
        setGuessLetters(
          //Prevented duplicate letters in state
        prevLetter => prevLetter.includes(letter) ? prevLetter : [...prevLetter, letter])
      }

    Option (2)
    get clicked letter by passing letter to handlerKey function

    function handleKey(letter){
      setGuessLetters(
        //Prevented duplicate letters in state
      prevLetter => prevLetter.includes(letter) ? prevLetter : [...prevLetter, letter])
    }

- keyboard letter style for gueeses

the guess letter is not in the correct, the key turn green color
the guess letter is wrong, the key turn red color

in this lesson, I know about clsx package for constructing className strings conditionally

- farewell display
I got farewell language from eleminated logic in language chips and I put this eleminated
language to array and show this languages by joining this array child in render status function

I don't know what is the condition for showing farewell language at first. I do !isGameOver condition 
for showing farewell message but it gots purple background since game start
When I saw lecture, I notice that the farewell message should display when user guess the wrong letter.
